# TRINETRA
### About the project:

     $ The project  allows the users to scan the documents and share the photo as pdf and
     Also we can do multiple  operations with it like cropping  the image ,rotate the  image in a  convenient
     way,binarize the image and search for a text in the document.
    
### Objective of trinetra:

     $ Picture taken  by an android based device  inorder to recite later. This application  will allow it's
     users to perform  many actions in few minutes,such as copy text  from these  afermentioned  documents 
     and modifying  it , instead of  wasting time  on retyping it.
    
     $ It should further  be able to search  for given keywords in the text  identified and also  generate a pdf.
    
### Techonology used in the project :
     
     $ An android application for image to text coversion using Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
     
     $ Language used :Java
     
### Main features :
       
     $ Covert images to pdf
     $ Recognize text in images
     $ Basic document management
     $ Search text in generated content
       
 ### Installation :
 
     $ To build and run the app, clone this project, open it as an existing project in Android Studio and run it.
      
  
 ### Support

     - Android 4.0 +


 ### Advantages

     - flexible
     - web or multi-media tie-up
     - user friendly
     - cost effective
     - inclined to adopt digitization
     
     - automates the manual traditional process by generating content as a digital version
     
     - digitize multiple pages in concurrent and time saving manner
     
     - efficient retrieval of content using indexing and searching
     
     -  The system has its advantages such as automation of mundane tasks ,less time complexity ,very small
        database and high adaptability to untrained inputs with only a small number of features to calculate.
        
### Future Direction

     - Government bodies, archivists, publishers etc. have a large number of printed documents stored physically
       which is inconvenient in searching, securing and maintaining as compared to digital documents.

     - We plan to build a prototype that will digitally migrate printed documents to editable text, without manually 
       flipping the pages. Our system will generate a indexed digital version of the document by using cloud based 
       OCR (Optical character recognition).
