# TRINETRA
### About the project:

     The project  allows the users to scan the documents and share the photo as pdf and
     Also we can do multiple  operations with it like cropping  the image, rotate the image in a convenient
     way,binarize the image and search for a text in the document.
    
### Objective of trinetra:

     - An android app capable of capturing specified number of images.
     - An app to crop the images captured as required.
     - An app capable of enhancing the image, i.e. binarizing the image.
     - This app also recognizes the text in this image.
     - This android app is further able to search for given keywords in the text identified and also generate a pdf.
     - And it can also store it in the local device.

    
### Techonology used in the project :
     
     - Android Studio
     - API used for image to text conversion is: Tesseract OCR(tesseract  or tess-2) api.
     - Language used: java 

### Main features :
       
     - Capture images and convert them to pdf
     - Crop, binarize the captured images.
     - Recognize text in images
     - Search text in generated content
     - Basic document management
      
 ### Support

     - Android 4.0 +

 ### Advantages

     - flexible
     - web or multi-media tie-up
     - user friendly
     - cost effective
     - inclined to adopt digitization
     
     - automates the manual traditional process by generating content as a digital version
     
     - digitize multiple pages in concurrent and time saving manner
     
     - efficient retrieval of content using indexing and searching
     
     -  The system has its advantages such as automation of mundane tasks ,less time complexity ,very small
        database and high adaptability to untrained inputs with only a small number of features to calculate.
        
### Future Direction

     - Make this app accessible to Government bodies, archivists, publishers etc. that have 
          a large number of printed documents stored physically which is inconvenient in 
          searching, securing and maintaining as compared to digital documents.
     - Enhance the features of the app further like crop and binarize features.
     - Integrating the voice assistance feature to our existing application. 
     - Make this app more accessible, especially the blind or people requiring reading assistance
          by reading it aloud for them using the accessibility feature.
     - We want to further develop the file management for this app.
     - Hence, this app can be a perfect one for users to perform many actions in few minutes,
          such as convert and save text from these afore mentioned documents and also use
          them to recite later.
     - This application will help us digitalize documents instead wasting time on retyping the text.
